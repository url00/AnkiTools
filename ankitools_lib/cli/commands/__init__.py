# ankitools_lib/cli/commands/__init__.py

# This package will contain modules for different CLI command groups.
# For example:
# - generate_cmds.py (for `ankitools generate ...`)
# - list_cmds.py (for `ankitools list ...`)
# - transform_cmds.py (for `ankitools transform ...`)

# Each command module will define its own Typer app (sub-app)
# which will then be added to the main app in cli/main.py.
