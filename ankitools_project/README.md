# AnkiTools

AnkiTools is a Python-based library and Command Line Interface (CLI) designed to automate common Anki tasks, enhance note creation, and help manage Anki decks more efficiently. It leverages AI capabilities (via Google Gemini) for certain features.

This project is a greenfield reimplementation and consolidation of functionalities previously found in the AnkiThing project.

## Features (Planned)

*   Unified Python library for Anki interaction and task automation.
*   Consistent CLI for accessing library functions.
*   Generation of arithmetic spelling cards.
*   AI-powered rephrasing of notes (e.g., "RandomBasic" style).
*   AI-powered descriptions for spelling words.
*   Deck and note management utilities.

## Installation (Placeholder)
